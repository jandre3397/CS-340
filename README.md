# CS-340
During my internship at Amazon, I learned firsthand the importance of creating maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. My main project involved building a HEAL Lambda function within the Shipwright workflow, which automated the tracking and updating of VFM statuses during the repair process of faulty CPUs. This project required me to develop a solution that was both robust and flexible, given the high standards and complex workflows at Amazon. This experience shaped my approach to the recent class project, where I built a CRUD Python module to manage database interactions for a dashboard.

Just like at Amazon, I focused on designing this CRUD module to be modular and well-documented, anticipating that it would need to connect to dashboard widgets in the next phase. By building a solid, reusable foundation, I made it easy to integrate the module into the dashboard without reworking core functionality. This approach saved time and ensured that the dashboard was reliable, allowing me to focus more on user experience and interface efficiency. Working this way reminded me of Amazon’s emphasis on building scalable, reusable solutions that can adapt to changing requirements—a mindset I now apply to all my projects.

My Amazon internship also taught me a systematic approach to problem-solving. For this project, I used a similar approach, starting with a deep understanding of the requirements and mapping out the interactions between the database and dashboard. Unlike some previous projects where I could focus on isolated functions, this one involved connecting multiple components and ensuring they worked seamlessly together. I applied strategies I’d seen in action at Amazon, like modularization, detailed documentation, and efficient indexing. Moving forward, these strategies will continue to guide me, especially as I work on more complex systems for future clients or employers.

Ultimately, my experience at Amazon showed me that software engineering is about creating solutions that serve real-world needs. If I were to bring a project like this CRUD module to a company like Amazon, it could streamline internal processes, improve data management, and support operational efficiency. This project reinforced my passion for building tools that make a tangible difference, and I’m excited to keep honing these skills to contribute meaningfully wherever I work next.
